# interpreter-for-software-development

# Summary
This program acts as an interpreter for an "x-language". After x-language source files are "compiled", the interpreter adds the list of byte codes into a list to be executed starting from the beginning of the list. The compiled files are assumed to be compiled correctly. The current scope of the interpreter works with two files: factorial.x.cod, fib.x.cod

# Notes
* License is included in this repository.
* factorial.x.cod and fib.x.cod are the only two files for this assignment that need to run correctly
* This is a new separate repository from the original assignment repository.
* Last update to program: March 17, 2018
